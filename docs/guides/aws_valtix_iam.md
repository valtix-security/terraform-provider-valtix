# AWS Valtix IAM
In order for Valtix to discover inventory and traffic, create Service VPCs and Spoke VPC protection, and deploy Valtix Gateways, the AWS Accounts need to be prepared with a set of IAM Roles and other configurations to grant the Valtix Controller the necessary permissions.  Valtix has an AWS Cloud Formation template that can be used to prepare the Accounts.  Terraform can also be used if the desire is to orchestrate the Accounts preparation and onboarding.  This is useful in order to automate the deployment of IAM Roles across a large number of AWS Accounts.

The module can be found at [Terraform AWS Setup](https://github.com/valtix-security/terraform-aws-setup)
