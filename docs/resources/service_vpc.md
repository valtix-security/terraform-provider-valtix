# valtix_service_vpc

Valtix Service VPC is used for AWS deployments to create a Valtix Service VPC as the destination for a Valtix Gateway deployment.  Please note that for AWS HUB mode deployment that Valtix Service VPC must be deployed as a pre-requisite and the HUB mode gateway will deploy in all availability zones defined in the availability_zones argument

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "aws_ec2_transit_gateway" "transit_gateway" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = "transit-gateway1"
  }
}


resource "valtix_service_vpc" service_vpc {
  name               = "service_vpc"
  csp_account_name   = "aws_account_1"
