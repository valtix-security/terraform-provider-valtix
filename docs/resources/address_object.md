# Resource: valtix_address_object
Manages address objects that can be used as source (for egress) or a target (backend) for ingress.

## Example Usage

### static address object
```hcl
resource "valtix_address_object" app1-ag {
  name            = "app1"
  description     = "Backend App"
  type            = "STATIC"
  value           = ["10.10.10.10"]
  backend_address = true
}
```

### dynamic address object (application) using a tag
```hcl
resource "valtix_address_object" app1-lb-tag {
  name            = "app1-lb-tag"
  description     = "application load balancer using a tag"
  type            = "DYNAMIC_APPLICATIONS"
  backend_address = true
  tag_key         = "tag-name"
  tag_value       = "tag-value"
}
```

### dynamic vpc, use all the IP addresses with in the VPC (including public ips)
```hcl
resource "valtix_address_object" vpc1-ag {
  name             = "vpc1"
  description      = "Backend VPC"
  type             = "DYNAMIC_VPC"
  vpc_id           = data.aws_vpc.gw_vpc.id
  csp_account_name = valtix_cloud_account.aws1.name
  region           = var.aws_region
}
```
